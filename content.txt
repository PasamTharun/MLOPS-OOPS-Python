    > What is __init__ in Python(Dunder Method)
    Imagine you buy a new mobile phone 📱.
        When you turn it on for the first time:
        Language is set
        Date and time are set
        Storage is prepared
        Default apps are ready
        That initial setup is what __init__ does for an object.
    > you can create a attribute outside then class?

    > Encapsulation
    > getter and setter
    > Static  method

    > inheritance
