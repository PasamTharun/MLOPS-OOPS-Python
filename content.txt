1.class and obj
2.class has data/attr and the methods
    > code walkthrough
    > attributes get called itself ,methods are called manually
3.why python is called oop?
    > everything in python is an obj (data structure ,data type etc)
    > Python is called an OOP language because it lets you create and work with objects using classes and supports all OOP concepts.
4.advantages of oops
    >Clean
    > Reusable
    > Maintainable
    > Scalable
5.End to end Project class
    > What is self?
    self means the current object.
    > What is __init__ in Python(Dunder Method)
    Imagine you buy a new mobile phone 📱.
        When you turn it on for the first time:
        Language is set
        Date and time are set
        Storage is prepared
        Default apps are ready
        That initial setup is what __init__ does for an object.
    > you can create a attribute outside then class?

    > Encapsulation
    > getter and setter
    > Static  method

6.inheritance
    > inheritance code example
    > Why inheritance is needed? (Code reuseability,parent has no access to child class)
    > what get inherited?---constructor,non private attributes,non private methods
    > constructor overloading and method overloading
    > super keyword(can be used only inside child class,can not access variables/attributes )
    > types of inheritance
